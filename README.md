# Branching
Branches is a way of having your own copy of the master code but diverging it too. This will allow you to continue to do work without messing with the master or the main line.

## Creating/Switching a branch

Use `git branch <branch name>` to create a new branch.
Then use `git checkout <branch name>` to switch between branches
Use again `git branch` to show all of the local branches you have, but if you want to see all of the branches even in the remote one (a.k.a. in the github repo) you can use `git branch -a` to show it all.
